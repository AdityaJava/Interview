Java: Interface vs Abstract Class
----------------------------------

Quick Summary:

Interface:
- Defines a contract (what to do).
- All methods are abstract by default (until Java 8).
- Cannot have constructors.
- All variables are public static final (constants).
- A class can implement multiple interfaces.
- Use when classes are unrelated but share common capabilities.

Abstract Class:
- Defines a base class with partial implementation (how to do).
- Can have both abstract and concrete methods.
- Can have constructors.
- Can have all types of variables.
- A class can extend only one abstract class.
- Use when classes are closely related and share code/state.

--------------------------------------------------------------

When to Use Interface:
----------------------
- You want to define a common behavior (like Flyable, Serializable).
- You want to achieve multiple inheritance.
- The classes are not part of the same hierarchy.

Example:
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Bird implements Flyable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Bird flies");
    }
}

class Drone implements Flyable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Drone flies");
    }
}

--------------------------------------------------------------

When to Use Abstract Class:
---------------------------
- You want to share code among closely related classes.
- You want to define non-static or non-final fields.
- You want to provide default behavior and force subclasses to implement specific methods.

Example:
abstract class Vehicle {
    int speed;

    Vehicle(int speed) {
        this.speed = speed;
    }

    abstract void start();

    void stop() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle stopped");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    Car(int speed) {
        super(speed);
    }

    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starting at speed: " + speed);
    }
}

--------------------------------------------------------------

Rule of Thumb:
--------------
Use Interface when:
- You want to define a contract.
- You need multiple inheritance.
- Classes are unrelated.

Use Abstract Class when:
- Classes share common behavior.
- You need to write partial implementation.
- You want constructors or non-final fields.
